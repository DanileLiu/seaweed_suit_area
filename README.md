# Global Estimates of Suitable Areas for Marine Algae Farming

**Abstract**

Marine algae (both macro and micro) have gained significant attention for their multiple ecosystem service functions, such as providing food and raw materials and mitigating climate change. Currently, the practice of large-scale algae farming is limited to Asian waters, but significant interest has arisen from other continents. There is a great need to estimate areas with suitable environmental conditions for expanding algae farming on a global scale. In most cases, previous studies have only considered nutrient availability and thermal constraints when assessing the potential for algae culture. This study uses species distribution models based on an ensemble consensus approach to determine the extent of suitable areas and takes into account multiple environmental factors that may affect the feasibility of algae culture. Our results indicate that approximately 20.8 million km2 of the ocean (~13.8% of the economic exclusive zones) is suitable for farming marine algae species, while most potential areas are distributed near the coastline. However, although several species are ideal for culture over a large spatial extent, their potential for commercial production is limited due to uncertain economic feasibility. Further clarification of the ecological values provided by seaweed farming may partly offset these considerations and build an ecologically friendly and financially viable algae mariculture industry. This study provides a scientific basis for decision-makers to understand potential expansion areas and feasible pathways for seaweed farming.
